# Install Miniconda3
The first step is to install a python distribution. You should find a copy of the installation file in your App Development folder:
~~~
c:\App Development
~~~
if you want to continue at home you can also download it from [https://conda.io/miniconda.html](https://conda.io/miniconda.html).
Click through the default options when installing.

When complete, you should have a shortcut to Anaconda Prompt in your Start menu. Run this program and enter the command:
~~~
python
~~~
to enter the Python interpreter.

You can now experiment in the interpreter by following tutorial examples starting at [https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/introduction.html](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/introduction.html).
