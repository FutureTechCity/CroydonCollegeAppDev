# Installing development software
We will need several layers of development software to create Apps:
* Miniconda3 - a Python distribution
* Spyder - an Integrated Development Environment (IDE)
* Kivy - an App development framework

## Install Miniconda3
The first step is to install a python distribution. You should find a copy of the installation file in your App Development folder:
~~~
c:\App Development
~~~
if you want to continue at home you can also download it from [https://conda.io/miniconda.html](https://conda.io/miniconda.html).
Click through the default options when installing.

When complete, you should have a shortcut to Anaconda Prompt in your Start menu. Run this program and enter the command:
~~~
python
~~~
to enter the Python interpreter.

You can now experiment in the interpreter by following tutorial examples starting at [https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/introduction.html](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/introduction.html).
## Install Spyder
Next, we need to install an integrated editor and debugger for Python. To do this, open your Anaconda Prompt and enter the following command:
~~~
conda install spyder
~~~
  
It will prompt you to agree before installing. Type y and enter. The installation can take a few minutes.

When it is complete, you should have a Spyder icon in your Start menu. Click this to run the Spyder IDE.
