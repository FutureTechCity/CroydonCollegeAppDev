# Install Spyder
Next, we need to install an integrated editor and debugger for Python. To do this, open your Anaconda Prompt and enter the following command:
~~~
conda install spyder
~~~
  
It will prompt you to agree before installing. Type y and enter. The installation can take a few minutes.

When it is complete, you should have a Spyder icon in your Start menu. Click this to run the Spyder IDE.
